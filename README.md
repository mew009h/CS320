How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I ensure that my code is functional and secure by constant testing, whether it be functional or nonfunctional testing.I could do functional testing by manually testing the code, then checking into the retrospective test results and fixing the code. Then I could do the nonfunctional testing,especially once it hits market. I could do the testing on the performance and security of the program.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I would listen to the needs and how they describe what they want, and then incorporate those descriptions into the program. That is the beauty of retrospective testing, and usability testing. You mix those two together and it is the perfect mix to meet the users needs and wants.

How do I approach designing software?

I try to meet all user standards and request. I try to break down all of the requests for the bare bones, and then build code from those requests.
